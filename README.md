# HybridPeer2Peer
HybridPeer2Peer Network Simulation

The project involves using of GNS3 tool for the simulation of the networks, we have created netowrks with different number of nodes . here we are trying to dintinguish between Server based Peer2Peer and Router based Peer2Peer network.

With the simulations we get to the conclusion that the server based Peer2Peer network i.e. the Hybrid Peer2Peer Network in the best option.
